### Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration is the practice of integrating code into a shared repository and building/testing each change automatically, as early as possible - usually several times a day.

--

### Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery adds that the software can be released to production at any time, often by automatically pushing changes to a staging system.

--

### Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment goes further and pushes changes to production automatically.
