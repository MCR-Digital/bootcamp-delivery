### Research tasks

* Do your environments all use the same package?
* What environments do you use (e.g. dev, prod), and do teams share them?
    * How are non-production environments kept a close match for production?
* How does configuration get into your application?
    * How should you manage secrets (e.g. passwords)?
    * How are they kept secret?
* Do you have any way of hiding features in specific environments?
