### User documentation and user training

You might think these are outdated concepts, but your organisation will carry out some similar activities with the same outcome.

You may even write release notes‚Äîthese are still very important with libraries we use and publish.

### Research tasks

* Do you have people who are in touch with customers?
    * How can they raise issues to you?
    * How can you advise them?
* Find out how you announce changes to your systems to your customers ***& the employees who support them***
    * Who are the stakeholders, and whose responsibility is it to contact them?
    * See if you can get involved in communicating releases
    * Better still, speak hello and form a relationship

### Research tasks (continued)

* Read the release notes for the current version of the framework you use most often
    * Note how they are (hopefully) written so that you understand them without reading code
