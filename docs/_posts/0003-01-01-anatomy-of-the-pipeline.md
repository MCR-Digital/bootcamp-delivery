### Anatomy of a pipeline

Chapter five of the Continuous Delivery book covers the ‘[Anatomy of the Deployment Pipeline](https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1621865)’. Read this to understand what tasks a pipeline automates, and how it gets code from your keyboard to the users.

Be sure to read ‘Deployment Pipeline Practices’.

You may choose not to read from ‘Implementing a Deployment Pipeline’ onwards.

### Make sure you understand what these mean:

These are some common features of CD pipelines.

- Artifacts
- Stages
- Jobs
- Tasks
- Approvals/Conditions
- Tests
- Notifications

### Research Tasks

* What do the stages in your pipeline do?
* Which of the deployment pipeline practices do you follow?
* How long does it take for code to reach production? 
    * How long does the first stage take to run?
    * Is it possible for you to get feedback about your code within five minutes?
    * Are/How are processes parallised to speed things up?

### Research tasks (continued)

* What should you do when the pipeline fails?
    * How can you get notifications if you cause the build to fail?
