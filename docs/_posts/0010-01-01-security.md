### TC13: Operates Effectively in the Industry Environment
#### Assessed Requirements

+ Can demonstrate working within operational requirements such as health and safety, budgets, brands and normal business protocols

Note:
This includes things like security practices  
Need to operate safely as a business, not just thinking about H&S

### An important message

The things you will learn today can be dangerous in the wrong hands.

Please be careful, and gain permission before you security test an application.

### SQL Injection

### SQL Injection

![sql injection](images/security/sql_injection_input.png)

--

### SQL Injection

```sql
select * from code where password = "testing123"
```

```sql
Our payload: " or 1 = 1 --
```

```sql
select * from code where password = "" or 1 = 1 --"
```

--

### SQL Injection - The fix

Use prepared statements

```java
var password = request.getParameter("password");
var query = "SELECT * FROM code WHERE password = ?";
var preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(query);
preparedStatement.setString(1, password);
var results = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
```

### Command Injection #1

--

### Command Injection #1

```python
@app.route('/output', methods=['POST'])
def output():
    if session.get('logged_in'):
        filename = request.form['filename']
        scan_results = subprocess.Popen(
            "clamscan "+filename,
            shell=True,
            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
            stdin=subprocess.PIPE
        ).stdout.read()
        return "<pre>" + scan_results + "</pre>"
    else:
        return '<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=/" />'
```

--

### Command Injection #1

```shell
clamscan testing123
```

```shell
Our payload: `pwd`
```

```shell
clamscan `pwd`
```

--

### Command Injection #1 - The fix

Avoid calling OS commands directly

```python
mkdir(dir_name)
```

vs

```python
system("mkdir " + dir_name)
```

--

### Command Injection #1 - The fix

Input validation

```shell
& | ; $ > < ` \ !
```

--

### Command Injection #2

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    char *freshclam="/usr/bin/freshclam";
    if (argc < 2){
        printf(
            "This tool lets you update antivirus rules" +
            "\nPlease supply command line arguments for freshclam\n"
        );
        return 1;
    }
    char *command = malloc(strlen(freshclam) + strlen(argv[1]) + 2);
    sprintf(command, "%s %s", freshclam, argv[1]);
    setgid(0);
    setuid(0);
    system(command);
    return 0;
}
```

--

### Command Injection #2

```c
sprintf(command, "%s %s", freshclam, argv[1]);
// /usr/bin/freshclam testing123
```

```c
Our payload: pwd || bash -i
```

```c
// /usr/bin/freshclam pwd || bash -i
```

--

### Command Injection #2 - The fix

Avoid calling OS commands directly

```python
mkdir(dir_name)
```

vs

```python
system("mkdir " + dir_name)
```

--

### Command Injection #2 - The fix

Input validation

```shell
& | ; $ > < ` \ !
```

### Questions

### Your turn!

### Juice Shop

Demo and scoreboard

--

### The challenges

- Find the admin's username
- Log in as the admin using SQL injection
- Find out how to give feedback with a star rating
- Can you modify the request to give a 0-star rating?
- If you finish all that, go nuts! -> localhost:3000/#/score-board

--

### I'm stuck!

0. Look at the network tab
1. Google it
2. https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/
3. Ask a mentor

### Where do these problems come from?

This article is a good read:

[You have critical security vulnerabilities in your software but you don’t know it yet!](https://beyondxscratch.com/2018/10/09/devsecops-owasp-you-have-critical-security-vulnerabilities-in-your-software-but-you-dont-know-it-yet/)

It describes how the dependencies you use can introduce security issues. It also talks about how you can better understand these, and learn to tackle them.

Your organisation may already have tools in place to help you with this.
