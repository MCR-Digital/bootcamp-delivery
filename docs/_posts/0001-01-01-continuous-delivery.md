+ Term covers many areas of the software development life cycle
+ These areas are part of a few different competencies
    + Mostly Deployment, but also some Testing and one or two others

--

### TC8: Deployment
 
> Can understand and utilise skills to build, manage and deploy code into enterprise environments

--

### TC8: Deployment
#### Assessed Requirements

> Apprentices can package and build completed programs as appropriate to the resources available for deployment and for migration to different environments, including:
  - developing appropriate user documentation
  - planning for user training
  - data migration

--

### TC8: What do you need to know?

+ How to package software for your chosen language and technology stack
+ How the software gets built from source code to something that can run
+ How the software can be promoted through different environments
+ How you make sure that your users can work out how to use the software
+ How you make sure that uses of your software are not disrupted by new releases

We already covered some parts of Continuous Delivery in a prior boot campâ€¦ remember setting up TravisCI?

Remind yourself what it means by watching [this 48 minute talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLBhVEo1OG4) from one of the authors of the book we are using today.

### Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration is the practice of integrating code into a shared repository and building/testing each change automatically, as early as possible - usually several times a day.

--

### Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery adds that the software can be released to production at any time, often by automatically pushing changes to a staging system.

--

### Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment goes further and pushes changes to production automatically.

+ We will be making heavy use of this today
+ It is the definitive book about CD
+ It was so good that no one has written a follow up
+ But, it was written in 2010, so the technologies have all changed
+ Core concepts are still valid though
+ The book has a [companion website](https://continuousdelivery.com/)

### How much to read?

We will give you specific chapters / sections of the book to read. But if you find you follow it, then it is a good book to read cover to cover (and to dip into).

### Research tasks

* What is/are your Continuous Delivery tool(s)?
    * Are there other tools in use in other parts of the organisation?
    * What else has been used, and why did you move to what you are using now?
