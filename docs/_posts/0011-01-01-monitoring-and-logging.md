### What does that actually mean?

+ Providing support for a system with other staff or users counts towards this
+ Using tools for diagnostics to provide that support is important
+ Important to be alerted to whether something is not working
    + Not just running—also whether it is providing the intended business value

--

### Monitoring happens at many levels

+ Business metrics such as the number of checkouts may inform us of widespread business impacting problems
+ Application level metrics (e.g. the number of requests) may give us early warning of potential issues
+ Infrastructure level metrics (e.g. how much CPU we are using, how much our infrastructure is costing) help us to spot inefficiencies
+ Similarly, financial monitoring has always been a thing and does the same thing with our money

Note:
Not the clearest description!

## Some reading to do

The ‘Monitoring infrastructure and applications’ section of [Continuous Delivery Chapter Eleven](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/continuous-delivery-reliable/9780321670250/ch11.html#page_318) has some background around this subject.

### Things to make sure you understand

+ What core business metrics should you be aware of e.g. customer check-outs?
+ How can you look at logs for the software that you write?
+ Are you able to follow up customer issues by tracing their request through your systems to see where something went wrong?
+ How are people alerted when the system/site is down?
+ When you release software, how do you know you didn’t break it?
